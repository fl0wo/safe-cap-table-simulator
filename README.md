</div>

## üöÄ Features

- **SAFE Support**: Full modeling of both pre-money and post-money SAFEs with caps, discounts
- **Visual Dilution Tracking**: Generate beautiful visualizations of equity dilution over time
- **High-Resolution Output**: Create presentation-ready cap table visuals
- **Typed API**: Fully TypeScript implementation with strong typing
- **Founder-Friendly**: Easy to understand how different financing scenarios impact founder equity

## üìä Example

This example shows how equity changes through different fundraising events:

```typescript
// Create a new company with founders and an option pool
const company = new Company({
  founders: [
    { name: 'Founder1', ownership: 45 }, 
    { name: 'Founder2', ownership: 45 }
  ],
  pools: [
    { note: 'Employee Equity Pool', ownership: 10 }
  ]
});

// Simulate equity events
company
  .giveEquity(5, 'Techstars')                             // Give 5% to accelerator
  .signSafe('uncapped', 100_000, 'Techstars', 20)         // Uncapped SAFE with 20% discount
  .signSafe(5_000_000, 150_000, 'Investor 1', undefined, 'pre-money') // Pre-money SAFE with $5M cap
  .signSafe(4_500_000, 200_000, 'Investor 2', 10, 'post-money') // Post-money SAFE with $4.5M cap and 10% discount
  .pricedRound(5_000_000, 1_000_000, 'Seed Round')        // Seed round at $5M pre-money valuation
  .logEquity()                                            // Print cap table to console
  .plot('equity-dilution.png');                           // Generate visualization
```

## üßÆ Understanding SAFEs

This simulator supports modern SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) agreements:

- **Pre-money SAFEs**: The older style where conversion happens based on pre-money valuation
- **Post-money SAFEs**: The newer YC-style where conversion happens based on post-money valuation
- **Uncapped SAFEs**: Converts based on the round price (with optional discount)
- **Capped SAFEs**: Converts based on the lower of cap price or round price (with optional discount)

The simulator handles all SAFE conversion calculations automatically when a priced round occurs.
